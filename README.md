# Library-Management-System
This project is a Library Management System built with JavaScript to manage books, patrons, and sections. It uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like inheritance and encapsulation, making it scalable and easy to maintain. The system tracks book availability and handles different patron types, simplifying library operations.
